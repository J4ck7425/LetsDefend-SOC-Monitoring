# LetsDefend-SOC-Monitoring
LetsDefend helps you build a blue team career with hands-on experience by investigating real cyber attacks inside a simulated SOC.

## Security Analyst
A security analyst protects an organization's computer systems and networks from cyber threats by monitoring suspicious activity, investigating incidents, and implementing security measures.

### Alert Severity
Alert severity is a categorization of alerts based on their potential risk and impact, LetsDefend uses levels like **low**, **medium**, **high**, and **critical** to help security teams prioritize which alerts to investigate first. This classification is determined by factors such as the type of threat, the sensitivity of the affected system, and the potential business impact of the event.

### Alert Type
Alert types are categorized by how they are generated, including **rule-based** (predefined rules for specific events), **behavior-based** (User and Entity Behavior Analytics), **threat intelligence-based** (known malicious indicators), and **anomaly-based** (deviations from normal activity). These alerts, triggered by events like failed logins or malware, inform security teams of potential threats for investigation.

- **ThreatIntel**: supplies insights into the attacker's TTPs and associated IOCs that can accelerate the investigation. This aids in incident response, containment, and recovery efforts
- **C2 (Command & Control)**: indicates a potential security incident where a compromised system is communicating with an attacker's server, often through a pattern of "beaconing". This communication allows the attacker to remotely control the infected machine for malicious activities, and a SIEM system detects this by monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns, connections to known malicious domains, or other anomalies
- **Persistence**: indicates that the SIEM has detected suspicious activity, or a series of actions, that suggest an attacker is trying to establish a long-term foothold in your network. Examples include correlating multiple events like failed logins followed by a successful one, the creation of new user accounts, or unusual access to privileged systems, which could point to a multi-stage attack
- **Brute Force**: generated when a SIEM system detects a pattern of repeated, failed login attempts, which indicates a possible brute force attack. This is often triggered by a high volume of failed logins from a single source IP address or for a single user account within a short period, correlated with other activities like unusual login times or locations. These alerts are crucial for identifying and responding to unauthorized access attempts quickly
- **Unauthorized Access**: a notification that a potential security breach has occurred, such as a user logging in without permission or a hacker gaining access to a system. These alerts are generated by predefined rules that analyze security data from logs, network traffic, and applications to flag suspicious activity, helping security teams investigate and respond to threats
- **Generic**: generated based on a broad, non-specific rule, such as a high volume of failed logins or unusual network traffic. These alerts are often created through generic integration methods and serve as a starting point for security teams, who must then analyze them, tune the rules to reduce false positives, and correlate them with other data to determine if a genuine threat exists
- **Exchange**: indicates a potential security threat in Microsoft Exchange. These alerts are based on predefined rules that analyze logs from the Exchange server to detect suspicious activities like multiple failed logins, access from unusual locations, or signs of exploitation, and are sent to security analysts for prompt investigation and response
- **Malware**: generated by analyzing logs from various sources for suspicious patterns. These alerts are triggered by rules that detect activities like known malware signatures, unusual process behavior, or connections to malicious domains, and they enable security teams to investigate and respond to threats quickly. Effective SIEM alerts can help minimize damage, contain attacks, and support forensic investigations
- **Proxy**: when a web proxy detects suspicious activity. The alert is based on proxy logs, which monitor traffic for malicious websites, unusual user behavior, or policy violations, and correlate this with other data to identify potential threats
- **APT Group**: signifies a potential high-level, targeted cyberattack, detected by correlating multiple events to identify sophisticated and persistent malicious activity. This alert could be triggered by unusual data transfers, abnormal login patterns, lateral movement, or specific malicious file and network behaviors associated with known APT tactics. Immediate response steps include isolating affected systems and investigating the correlated events to understand the full scope of the attack
- **Privilege Escalation**: when it detects suspicious activity that indicates an attacker is trying to gain higher-level access to a network or system. These alerts are critical because they highlight attempts to move from a low-privileged account to an administrative one, enabling the detection of malicious actions like disabling security controls or stealing sensitive data before significant damage occurs
- **Ransomware**: flagging suspicious activity that could indicate a ransomware attack. These alerts are triggered by analyzing log data from various sources to detect patterns like unusual file encryption, unauthorized access attempts, and malicious script executions. The goal is to give security teams immediate warning of a potential threat so they can investigate and respond quickly to minimize damage
- **Data Leakage**: notifies security teams of potential unauthorized transfers of sensitive data outside the organization's network. These alerts are generated by monitoring and analyzing logs, user behavior, and network traffic for patterns indicative of data exfiltration, such as an unauthorized user downloading confidential information or sensitive data moving to an unknown location. A well-tuned SIEM can detect such threats in real-time, allowing security teams to respond quickly to prevent escalation and minimize damage
- **Web Attack**: flags a potential web-based security threat by analyzing logs from various sources like web servers, firewalls, and applications. These alerts are generated by correlating seemingly benign events, such as unusual traffic or login attempts from new locations, to identify complex attack patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed. They enable security teams to respond quickly to incidents, prioritize threats, and investigate the nature and scope of an attack
- **LOLBin**: indicates a "Living Off the Land Binaries" (LOLBins) attack. These alerts are triggered when a system detects suspicious activity using legitimate, pre-installed operating system tools (like PowerShell, certutil, or rundll32) for malicious purposes, such as downloading malware, executing code, or moving laterally within a network. To respond, security teams typically investigate the specific LOLBin and command-line arguments, analyze the user and entity behavior, and use the findings to tune SIEM rules and enhance detection capabilities
